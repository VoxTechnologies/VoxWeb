          <p class="opacity-8 ">Vox Technologies, Inc. (“Vox”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. We have prepared this Privacy Policy (“Privacy Policy”) to describe our practices regarding the personal information we collect from users on our website (the "Site"), our mobile application {the "App") and the services offered through the Site and App, and any orders that you place (collectively, the “Services”).</p>


          <h2 class="small  margin-top-5 margin-bottom-2 ">Information We May Collect</h2>
		  <p class="margin-bottom-1 ">We may collect information from or about you (such as your name, address, phone number, email, payment information) or your devices in a variety of ways, including:</p>
          <ul>
			  <li><strong>Through our Site, App, and Services</strong>: We may collect information from or about you through our websites, software applications, social media pages, email messages, or any other Services, including when you sign up for a newsletter, make a purchase, or register your product with us.</li>
			  <li><strong>From other sources</strong>: We may receive information about you from other sources, such as public databases, joint marketing partners, and social media platforms.</li>
			  <li><strong>Through your browser or device</strong>: Certain information is collected by most browsers or automatically through your device, such as your Media Access Control (MAC) address, computer type (Windows or Macintosh), screen resolution, operating system name and version, device manufacturer and model, language, Internet browser type and version, and the name and version of App you are using. We use this information to ensure that the Services function properly.</li>
		  </ul>      
		  <p class="margin-top-2 margin-bottom-1 ">When you visit our website or otherwise use our Services, we may use cookies, pixel tags, analytics tools, and other similar third-party technologies to help provide and improve our Services, and as detailed below:</p>
		  <ul>
				<li><strong>Cookies</strong>: Cookies are pieces of information stored directly on the computer that you are using. Cookies allow us to collect information such as browser type, time spent on the Services, pages visited, language preferences, and other web traffic data. We, and our service providers, use the information for security purposes, to facilitate online navigation, to display information more effectively, to personalize your experience while using the Services, and to otherwise analyze user activity. We can recognize your computer to assist your use of the Services. We also gather statistical information about the usage of the Services in order to continually improve their design and functionality, understand how the Services are used, and assist us with resolving questions regarding the Services. Cookies further allow us to select which of our offers are most likely to appeal to you and to display them to you. We may also use cookies to see how you interact with our offers, and we may use cookies or other files to understand your use of our websites.</li>
				<li><strong>Opting out of Cookies</strong>: If you do not want information collected through the use of cookies when using your Vox Account or our website, there is a simple procedure in most browsers (e.g., Safari, Chrome, Firefox) that allows you to automatically decline cookies or gives you the choice of declining or accepting the transfer to your computer of a particular cookie(s). However, if you do not accept these cookies, you may experience some inconvenience in your use of the Services. For example, we may not be able to recognize your computer, and you may need to log in every time you visit the applicable Services.</li>
				<li><strong>Pixel tags and other similar technologies</strong>: Pixel tags (also known as web beacons and clear GIFs) may be used in connection with some Services to, among other things, track the actions of users of the Services (including email recipients), measure the success of our marketing campaigns, and compile statistics about usage of the Services and response rates.</li>
				<li><strong>Analytics tools</strong>: We use website and application analytics services provided by third parties (such as Google Analytics) that use cookies and other similar technologies to collect information about website or application use and to report trends, without identifying individual visitors. The third parties that provide us with these services may also collect information about your use of third-party websites. You can learn how to opt out of analytics by downloading the Google Analytics opt-out browser add-on, available <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout" target="_blank">here.</a></li>

		  <p class="margin-top-2 margin-bottom-2 ">We retain the information we collect from or about you, our products, and our services for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. When the information is no longer necessary for these purposes, we delete it or keep it in a form that does not identify you. When determining this retention period, we take into account various criteria, such as the type of products and services requested by or provided to you, the nature of our relationship with you, the impact on the services we provide to you if we delete some information from or about you, and retention periods required by law.</p>
		  <p class="margin-bottom-2 ">We also collect information in a form that does not, on its own, permit direct association with any specific individual. We may collect, use, transfer, and disclose non-personally identifiable data for any purpose. If we do combine non-personally identifiable data with your personal information, the combined information will be treated as personal information for as long as it remains combined.</p>

Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us of the problem by contacting us in accordance with the “How to contact us” section below.</p>
		  <p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">Additionally, if you sell or transfer your Vox product to another person, please notify us so that we can determine whether additional steps are required to help safeguard information from or about you from disclosure to the purchaser or transferee of the Vox product.</p>
		  <p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">This Policy does not address, and we are not responsible for, the privacy, information, or other practices of any third parties, including any third party operating any site or service to which our Services link. The inclusion of a link on our Services does not imply endorsement of the linked site or service by us or by our affiliates, nor does it imply an affiliation with the third party.</p>
		  <p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">In addition, our products and services are not directed to individuals under the age of sixteen (16), and we request that these individuals not provide any information to Vox.</p>
		  
		  <h3 class="small  margin-top-2 margin-bottom-1 ">Cross Border Transfers</h3>
			<p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">Our products and services are controlled and operated from Japan. Information from or about you or your use of our products or services may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers. Those countries may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided that information. When we transfer information from or about you or your use of our products or services to other countries, we will protect it as described in this Privacy Policy. By using our products or services, or otherwise providing information to us, you consent to the transfer of information from or about you or your use of our products or services to countries outside of your country of residence, including Japan.</p>
			<p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">We may rely on various legal grounds to collect, use, and otherwise process your information, including: your consent; that the information is necessary for the performance of a contract with you; to comply with a legal obligation; to protect your, or someone else’s vital interests; or for a legitimate interest that is balanced against your rights and interests. These legitimate interests may include Vox’s interest in improving its products and services, enhancing safety and security, protecting Vox or its business partners against wrongful conduct, and responding to customer inquiries and claims. Where applicable, we will inform you whether and why we need certain information from you, for example, whether we need the information to fulfill a legal or contractual requirement and what the consequences are of not providing the information.</p>

		  <h3 class="small  margin-top-2 margin-bottom-1 ">Updates to This Policy</h3>
		  <p class="margin-top-1 margin-bottom-1">We may occasionally update this Policy. Please take a look at the “Last Updated” legend at the bottom of this page to see when this Policy was last revised.
